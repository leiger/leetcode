# 100. Same Tree
# recursion way(DFS)
# no recursion: stack(DFS)  pop()  append()

# 101. Symmetric Tree
# recursion (DFS), we need to form a new function, 
# cause we need two input
# no recursion(the same as #100)

# 110. Balanced Binary Tree
# DFS
# the height of each subtree should be record and compared

# 111. Minumum Depth of Binary Tree
# Both empty; one empty; no empty

# 112. Maxmum Depth of Binary Tree


# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
# preorder; inorder; postorder

# 106. Construct Binary Tree from inorder and postorder Traversal

# 199. Binary Tree Right Side View
# level(depth) and list

# 261. Graph Valid Tree
# 边数和节点数的关系；是否有可能形成环

# 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
# reversed preorder
# 还可以用栈
